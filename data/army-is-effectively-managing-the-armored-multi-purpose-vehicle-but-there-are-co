We determined whether the Army effectively managed the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle acquisition program. The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle is replacing the Armored  Personnel Carrier (M113) that entered service in 1960. According to the Army, the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle will provide sufficient protection, mobility, and network-enabled functions to maneuver with and support combat vehicles throughout a range of military operations.
This report is a result of Project No. D2016-D000AT-0130.000.
