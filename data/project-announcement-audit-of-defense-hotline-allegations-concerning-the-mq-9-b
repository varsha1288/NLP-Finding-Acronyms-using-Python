We plan to begin the subject audit in April 2018. We are conducting this audit in response to allegations made to the Defense Hotline. Our objective is to determine whether the U.S. Air Force is: (1) allowing the contractor to inappropriately charge for MQ-9 Block 5 Reaper repairs prior to DoD accepting the aircraft, (2) using the MQ-9 Block 5 Reaper aircraft to support operational missions, and (3) procuring excess MQ-9 Block 5 spare parts.
