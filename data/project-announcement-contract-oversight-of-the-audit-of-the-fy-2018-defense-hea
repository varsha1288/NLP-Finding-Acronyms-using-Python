We plan to begin the oversight in March 2018. We contracted with the independent public accounting firm of Kearney & Company, P.C., to audit the Defense Health Agency Contract Resource Management Basic Financial Statements for fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, and 2017. The objective of the audit is to determine whether the FY 2018 Defense Health Agency Contract Resource Management financial statements and related notes, are presented fairly, in all material respects, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
