We plan to begin the subject review in September 2018. We are conducting this project in response to Public Law 111-84, "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010," section 2835, October 28, 2009.   This act requires the Department of Defense Inspector General (the chairman of the Interagency Coordination Group) to provide a report to Congress by February 1, 2019, that summarizes the programs and operations funded with amounts appropriated or otherwise made available for military construction in Guam.  Our objective is to compile a detailed statement of all obligations, expenditures, and revenues associated with military construction in Guam.
