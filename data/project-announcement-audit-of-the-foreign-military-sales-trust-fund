We plan to begin the subject audit in March 2018. Our objective is to determine whether the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) implemented effective controls over financial reporting for the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Trust Fund. In addition, we will determine if DSCA and DFAS performed effective reconciliations of the FMS Trust Fund account balances as of September 30, 2017.
