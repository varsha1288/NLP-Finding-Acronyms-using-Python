We plan to begin the subject review in March 2018. We have contracted with the independent public accounting firm of Kearney and Company to audit the Military Retirement Fund Basic Financial Statements for FY 2018. This audit is required by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended, which requires that financial statements of a Government agency be audited by the Inspector General or by an independent external auditor, as determined by the Inspector General. The objective of the audit is to determine whether the financial statements as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, are presented fairly and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
