We plan to begin the subject audit in February 2018. We are announcing this audit in response to a congressional request in a classified annex to the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2017. This is the second and final audit related to the FY 2017 congressional request on protecting ballistic missile defense system technical information. Our objective is to determine whether the DoD Components implemented effective security controls and processes at DoD facilities to protect classified and unclassified Ballistic Missile Defense System technical information from internal and external cyber threats.
