We plan to begin the subject audit in August 2018. We are conducting this joint audit as a cooperative effort with the U.S. Army Audit Agency, Naval Audit Service, and Air Force Audit Agency. The audit objective is to determine whether DoD Components are leveraging cybersecurity reciprocity to reduce redundant test and assessment efforts when authorizing information technology through the Risk Management Framework process.
