We determined whether the Air Combat Command (ACC) and U.S. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) implemented the recommendations in DODIG-2014-062, “Improvements Needed in the Stocking of Air Force Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) Support and Repair Spare Kits in Guam,” April 17, 2014. In April 2015, the Air Force War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Global Management Office transitioned from the ACC to the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). Therefore, we determined whether the AFMC implemented the recommendations in DODIG-2014-062 that were originally directed to the ACC.
