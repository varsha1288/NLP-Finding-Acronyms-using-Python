Our planned oversight will begin immediately. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, DoD, requested an audit of the Defense Information Systems Agency General Fund Financial Statements for FY 2018. We contracted with the independent public accounting firm of Kearney & Company, P.C (Kearney & Company) to perform the audit. The objective of the audit is to determine whether the Defense Information Systems Agency General Fund Financial Statements and related note disclosures were fairly presented in all material respects and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
