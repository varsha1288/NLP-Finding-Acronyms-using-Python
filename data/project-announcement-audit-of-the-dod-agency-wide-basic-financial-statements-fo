We plan to begin the subject audit in December 2017. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended, requires this audit. In accordance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the DoD Office of Inspector General is the principal auditor for the DoD Agency-Wide Basic Financial Statements. Our objective is to determine whether the DoD Agency-Wide Basic Financial Statements as of September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017, taken as a whole, were presented fairly, in all material respects, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
