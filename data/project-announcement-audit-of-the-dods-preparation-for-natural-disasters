We plan to begin the subject audit in August 2018. We are conducting this audit in coordination with seven Offices of Inspector General, as part of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) Disaster Assistance Working Group - Cross Cutting Functional Effort. Our objective is to determine to what extent DoD is prepared to respond to upcoming natural disasters.
