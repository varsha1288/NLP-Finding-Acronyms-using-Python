Background
On December 18, 2015, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, including Title I – CISA. CISA Section 107(b) requires the Inspectors General of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, and Treasury, in consultation with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community and the Council of Inspectors General on Financial Oversight, to jointly report to Congress on actions taken over the most recent two-year period to carry out the CISA requirements.

Results
Each Office of Inspector General independently obtained the required assessments on its agency’s implementation of the CISA requirements and provided the results to us. We compiled the results in this report. We provided a discussion draft of this report to the participating Offices of Inspectors General and the Council of Inspectors General on Financial Oversight for their review and comment.
This report is a result of Project No D2016-D000FT-0121.000.
