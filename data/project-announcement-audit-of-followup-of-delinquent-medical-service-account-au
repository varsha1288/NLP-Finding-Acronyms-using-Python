We plan to begin the subject audit in December 2017. Our objective is to determine whether the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Health Agency, Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, U.S. Army Medical Command, and Air Force Surgeon General implemented actions to correct problems identified in prior DoD OIG reports related to the collection of outstanding balances of medical service accounts. Further, we will summarize systemic issues regarding delinquent medical service accounts.
