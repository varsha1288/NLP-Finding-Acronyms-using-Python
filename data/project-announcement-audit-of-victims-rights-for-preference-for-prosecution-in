We plan to begin the subject audit in August 2018. This audit was initiated in response to requirements in the House Armed Services Committee report to accompany the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. Our objective is to determine whether victims of sexual-related offenses have been consulted regarding their preference about whether the covered offenses should be prosecuted by court-martial or in a civilian court with jurisdiction over the offense.
