We plan to begin the subject audit in May 2018. Our objective is to ( 1) summarize cybersecurity reports issued and testimonies made by the DoD audit community and the Government Accountability Office between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018, (2) identify gaps in audit coverage based on the five functions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, and (3) identify Cybersecurity risk areas for DoD management to address. The summary will support our response to requirements in Public Law 106-531, "Reports Consolidation Act of 2000," Section 3516(d), November 22, 2000, and Public Law 113-283, "Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014," Section 3555, December 18, 2014.
